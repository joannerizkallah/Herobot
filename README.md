# Herobot

HeroBot is a project for the Mechatronics System Design 2 course, designed to rescue survivors under the rubble resulting from earthquakes, and thus minimizing risks in search and rescue missions.

HeroBot has a camera that can detect humans using a convolution neural network trained using our very own dataset, it can solve a maze algorithm and successfully reach the victim, it has a Fuzzy based cruise controller, obstacle avoidance, and teleoperation using TKinter. 

The project utilizes Raspberry Pi 4, an MPU9250, Hbridges, and various sensors. Check out the report for details.
